					  	<h3>Introduction</h3>
					    <p>The magazine spread design is a one-week individual project that require student to go outside beyond the classroom to explore and search for the architectural space as a shooting location, which also needs to be a neutral background for portrait photo taking. The student would look for adequate model on his/her own. According to the theme, the model qualifications of whom should be in different background from the photographer’s. Eventually, integrate every element in a 3-spread (totally 6 pages) and place the component lead to a cohesive composition to accomplish the task. </p>

					  	<h3>Process</h3>
					    <p>At the starting point, I carefully read the requirement of the project which is designated to capture a model composed in an architectural space, and together to unite while representing a theme that would be put on a 3-page spread as in a hypothetical magazine. Then with a primary idea in mind, I started a plan to visit the site and seek around the best scenes and camera angle to prepare the real shooting later on. The shooting procedure went well with given instruction to the model to integrate with the shooting scene elements. Therefore, in post-production; I could have plenty of photos for selection. </p>

					    <p>By utilizing the digital softwares (Adobe Lightroom 2018, Illustrator 2018) to apply photo treatment on the images into black and white, and adjusted the exposure, sharpness, brightness and many of others, section by section to better optimize the balance of each photo to represent the most out of its theme. I was also inspired by the literal guideline readings and layout collection “Harper’s Bazaar” according to the famous art director Alexey Brodovitch. “Design is an iterative process” always remind me there are lots of diverse methods to play around the possibilities and arrange.</p>
