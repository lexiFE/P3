					  	<h3>Introduction</h3>
					    <p>The magazine spread design is a one-week individual project that require student to go outside beyond the classroom to explore and search for the architectural space as a shooting location, which also needs to be a neutral background for portrait photo taking. The student would look for adequate model on his/her own. According to the theme, the model qualifications of whom should be in different background from the photographer’s. Eventually, integrate every element in a 3-spread (totally 6 pages) and place the component lead to a cohesive composition to accomplish the task. </p>

					  	<h3>Process</h3>
					    <p>Before the animation process began, the team and I would set up a few meetings to propose the settings, character and the plot for each scene, in our self-developed creative animation project. In order to construct a fluent and comprehensive story to the audience, we thought about the doability of shaping our own made characters and the feasibility of the animated functions to the team. Later on, each student is allowed to use the the second individual assignment whose requirement is to realistic, in their later group project’s use. I considered this as an opportunity to start the project ahead and it is beneficial not only to myself but also for the team as well. Therefore, I built the cafe scene in 3 dimensional from scratch. </p>
