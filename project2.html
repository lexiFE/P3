					  	<h3>Introduction</h3>
					    <p>A final short film of an animated video that the theme is opened to the student and the group. Students are required to generate concept through exploring various thematic animation examples online. Then the group could start sketching out the storyboard to describe their own stories scene by scene, and with each character multiple views to demonstrate how the figure would look like. Adjust the animation design flexibly, depending on if the project doable in a given short period of time. The animation should have a clear theme, the actions in the plot should be well scripted and reasonable to attract attention and or the resonance of the people. The overall goal is to have the short film easily to understand to the audience and bridge an emotional connection between real people and fictional characters.</p>

					  	<h3>Process</h3>
					    <p>Before the animation process began, the team and I would set up a few meetings to propose the settings, character and the plot for each scene, in our self-developed creative animation project. In order to construct a fluent and comprehensive story to the audience, we thought about the doability of shaping our own made characters and the feasibility of the animated functions to the team. Later on, each student is allowed to use the the second individual assignment whose requirement is to realistic, in their later group project’s use. I considered this as an opportunity to start the project ahead and it is beneficial not only to myself but also for the team as well. Therefore, I built the cafe scene in 3 dimensional  from its storyboard scratch. </p>

					  	<h3>Reflection</h3>
					    <p>After finished this animation project, I am amazed by how the Maya software is able to allow the modelers creating many photorealistic objects as they want. By using maya and some references from the internet, I was able to create the scenes from a cube to light bulb, the lamppost and the cafe, to adapt with the plot of “The One”. Therefore, my cafe and park scenes for assignment two were all applied in the project. Though, I think there are still many potential modeling skills for me to explore. </p>
						
						<p>The process of making an animated film needs lots of decision-making and considerations. So, a good communication within the team and cooperation are particularly significant. According to the feedback from the teaching assistant, in order to achieve of modelling and animating the facial expression of the character; the team might need to re-consider of how to redesign the figure so that it would be easier for the whole team to operate in the Maya 2017 software. Hence, we decided to change the faces of the characters from making a head inside a half cardiac body shifted to a half heart-shape figure directly. And, the result of the change has a better cartoon-look and different facial expressions were capable to implement sufficiently to represent character’s emotion in various stages.  The flexibility to change accordingly for the purpose of developing the project to a higher level should be included in the range of a designer’s capabilities.
